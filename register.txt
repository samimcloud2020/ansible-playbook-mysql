Introduction to Ansible Register
Ansible register is a way to capture the output from task execution and store it in a variable.
This is an important feature, as this output is different for each remote host, 
and the basis on that we can use conditions loops to do some other tasks. 
Also, each register value is valid throughout the playbook execution.
So, we can make use of set_fact to manipulate the data and provide input to other tasks accordingly. 
In this article we will learn and see examples of using register in different scenarios.
We will also see how only a piece of information in the registered variable can be used.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- hosts: all
  user: root
  become: True
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure pwgen is installed
      apt:
         name: pwgen
         state: present
         update_cache: True
    - name: Generate password
      shell: pwgen -N 1 -s 30
      register: mypass
    - name: Print the generated password
      debug:
      msg: "The password is {{ mypass }}"
      
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
The most important properties of each of the register variables are as follows:

cmd – The command that ran to generate the output.

stdout – The output of the command.

stderr – The error output of the command.

start – The date and time when the command began executing.

end – The date and time when the command finished executing.

delta – The time taken to run the command. This is the difference between the end and the start properties.

stdout_lines – An array containing each output line of the command.
Same as stdout, but stdout separates the lines using a newline (\n) characters instead of arrays.

stderr_lines –  An array containing each error output line of the command. 
Same as stderr, but stderr separates the lines using newlines (\n) characters instead of arrays.

- hosts: all
  user: root
  become: True
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure pwgen is installed
      apt:
         name: pwgen
         state: present
         update_cache: True
    - name: Generate password
      shell: pwgen -N 1 -s 30
      register: mypass
    - name: Print the generated password
      debug:
      msg: "The password is {{ mypass.stdout }}"

      Store Directory Contents
In this example, I will show you how to store the contents of a directory in a variable using the Ansible register module,
as well as how to iterate over them.

- hosts: all
  user: root
  become: True
  tasks:
    - name: List all files and directories in /home/ansible
      shell: ls /home/ansible
      register: dir_contents
    - name: Print directory contents using loops
      debug:
        msg: "{{ item }}"
      loop: "{{ dir_contents.stdout_lines }}"
      
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Back Up Directory
In this example, I will show you how to back up a directory using the Ansible register, file, and copy modules.

- hosts: all
  user: root
  become: True
  tasks:
    - name: Get home directory /home/ansible contents
      shell: ls /home/ansible
      register: dir_contents
    - name: Create a new directory /tmp/ansible
      file:
        path: /tmp/ansible
        state: directory
    - name: Backup home directory /home/ansible to /tmp/ansible
      copy:
        src: /home/ansible/{{ item }}
        dest: /tmp/ansible/
        remote_src: True
      loop: "{{ dir_contents.stdout_lines }}
      
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      
       Run or Skip Tasks
In this example, I will show you how to run or skip tasks, 
depending on the variable you have registered, using the register module.

- hosts: ubuntu20
  user: ansible
  become: True
  tasks:
    - name: List directory contents
      shell: ls /home/ansible/test3
      register: dir_contents
    - name: Check if directory is empty
      debug:
        msg: "Directory is empty."
     when: dir_contents.stdout == ""
     --------------------------------------------------------------
