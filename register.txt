Introduction to Ansible Register
Ansible register is a way to capture the output from task execution and store it in a variable.
This is an important feature, as this output is different for each remote host, 
and the basis on that we can use conditions loops to do some other tasks. 
Also, each register value is valid throughout the playbook execution.
So, we can make use of set_fact to manipulate the data and provide input to other tasks accordingly. 
In this article we will learn and see examples of using register in different scenarios.
We will also see how only a piece of information in the registered variable can be used.

- hosts: all
  user: root
  become: True
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure pwgen is installed
      apt:
         name: pwgen
         state: present
         update_cache: True
    - name: Generate password
      shell: pwgen -N 1 -s 30
      register: mypass
    - name: Print the generated password
      debug:
      msg: "The password is {{ mypass }}"
