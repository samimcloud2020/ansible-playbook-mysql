       What is {{ item }} in Ansible?
item is not a command, but a variable automatically created and populated by Ansible in tasks which use loops. In the following 
example: - debug: msg: "{{ item }}" with_items: - first - second. the task will be run twice: first time with the variable item set to first ,
the second time with second
